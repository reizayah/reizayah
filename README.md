# 👋🏾 Hey, I'm **Izayah Jean-Felix**

### **Software Engineer | AI + Data Engineering | iOS Developer | Systems Automation | Home-Lab Engineer | Network Engineer**

I build intelligent systems, automation tools, and high-performance apps across mobile, backend, and cloud environments.  
My work blends **AI/ML**, **mobile development**, **networking**, and **systems engineering** to solve real problems.

I’m currently pursuing opportunities in **Software Engineering**, **Network Engineering**, and **Data Engineering**, and preparing to relocate to **Washington, D.C.**
